        <p>These candied grapes are the perfect treat for everybody. You can customize the flavour with any of your favourite hard candies, such as jolly ranchers, poprocks, or warheads.</p>
        <p>So what exactly are "crack grapes" anyways? These are grapes dipped in candied syrup, then coated in your favourite candy flavours.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 lbs grapes</li>
            <li>2 c sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 c water</li>
            <li>1/2 c light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>100 toothpicks or skewers</li>
            <li>food colouring (optional, use food coloring gels not drops)</li>
            <li>1-2 packages of your favourite candy</li>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your grapes: Rinse grapes and then insert toothpicks or skewers into the stem end of the grape. Set on a paper towel and dry the grapes before dipping in the syrup.</li>
                <li>In a heavy bottom saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and corn syrup and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. You should maintain the best rolling boil that you can, stirring frequently, without letting the syrup boil over. Boil for about 5 minutes to reach the right temperature.</li>
                <li>You will need a candy thermometer to confirm when the syrup has reached 300-305 degrees F (148-152 degrees C). (see notes) This is the hard crack stage
                <li>Have a parchment paper-lined baking sheet ready to place coated crack grapes on once coated with candy where they can dry (set).</li>
                <li>Stir the vanilla extract in to the syrup. Carefully dip each grape into the syrup (the syrup will be hot!!), moving quickly to get the syrup covering over the entirety of the grape and to sprinkle the coated grapes with the crushed Jolly Rancher flavors (or roll in a bowl that is tipped sideways for easy coating).</li>
                <li>Set your coated crack grapes on the parchment paper and allow them to dry for about 30 minutes. Carefully remove the toothpicks and serve within a few hours.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
